/**
 * Main Screen - Entry point with complete navigation
 * 
 * This is the main file to view the output. It defaults to the Location section
 * and provides complete navigation for both Help & Support sections and the 
 * Location section with all 7 screens.
 * 
 * Default Screen: Location (Saved Addresses)
 * 
 * Navigation Structure:
 * - LocationNavigator (default/main screen - complete Location flow with 7 screens)
 *   - Saved Addresses (Empty/List)
 *   - Location Search
 *   - Search Results
 *   - Map Address Pin
 *   - Enter Complete Address
 *   - Success Modal
 * - CustomerSupport (Help & Support items)
 *   - HelpSubSection (FAQ screens for each help category)
 * 
 * Location Navigation Flow:
 * 1. Saved Addresses (Empty/List) → 2. Location Search → 3. Search Results
 * → 4. Map Address Pin → 5. Enter Complete Address → 6. Success Modal
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Import and use this component as the main screen
 * - All navigation flows are handled internally
 * - Ready for React Navigation integration
 * 
 * Example:
 * ```tsx
 * import MainScreen from './src/screens/MainScreen';
 * 
 * function App() {
 *   return <MainScreen onBackPress={() => navigation.goBack()} />;
 * }
 * ```

 * Features:
 * - Defaults to Location screen on load
 * - Complete navigation flow for all screens
 * - Dummy data with API placeholders
